<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">M/s CWC (M/s Central Warehousing Corporation) at IDPL Road, 
  Kukatpally has been licensed to operate public bonded warehouse under Section 
  <I>57 </I>of Customs Act, 62. Different importers can keep their imported goods 
  which are fit for bonding under warehousing procedure. The goods are permitted 
  to be warehoused without payment of duty subject to execution of required bond 
  under section <I>59 </I>of Customs Act, 62. In terms of Sec. 69 of the Customs 
  Act. 1962, the warehousing period is specified as one year. Extension for a 
  period of another six months can be granted by Commissioner and Chief Commissioner 
  is empowered for further period of extension to be granted as he may deem fit. 
  The goods are permitted clearance against Ex-bond Bills of Entry in part or 
  in full subject to payment of applicable duties. The free period for levying 
  interest in respect of warehousing goods has been increased from 30 days to 
  90 days in the Financial Bill, 2003. Interest @ 15 % is chargeable for the goods 
  kept beyond 90 days period. In case of non-clearance of goods, the bond executed 
  in terms of Section 72 will be enforced beyond prescribed time limits. Importers 
  also can claim clearances under valid EPCG, DEEC licences wherever applicable. 
  Sec. 15(1)(b) of Customs Act. 1962 has been amended in the Financial Budget 
  2003. The presentation of the bill of entry for (ex-bond) home consumption is 
  the relevant date for determination of rate of duty. Earlier i.e. before budget, 
  the date of physical removal of the goods from the warehousing was the criterion 
  to determine the releveant date for the purpose of rate of duty. The importer 
  can relinquish the title after warehousing of the goods subject to payment of 
  rent, interest and other charges including penalities if any in terms of Sec. 
  68 of the Custms Act. 1962.</P>
