        Parks (STPs) are export oriented projects catering to the needs of software 
        development for exports. STPs can be set up by the Central Government,State 
        Government, Public or Private Sector Undertakings or any combination thereof. 
        An STP may be an individual unit by itself or it may be one of such units 
        located in an area designated as STP Complex by the Ministry of Information 
        Technology. The Government has already set up Software Technology Parks 
        at Pune, Bangalore, Bhubaneshwar, Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram, Gandhinagar 
        and Noida. In these Parks all the required facilities are made available. 
        The STP Scheme is administered by the Ministry of Information Technology.</font>

        encouraging exports of electronic hardware items including hard disk drives, 
        computers, television, etc., such parks have been developed by the Ministry 
        of Information Technology. An Electronic Hardware Technology Park (EHTP) 
        may be an individual unit by itself or a unit located in a area designated 
        as EHTP Complex. As in the case of STP Scheme, the EHTP Scheme is also

        STP Scheme, a software development unit can be set up for the purpose 
        of development of software, data entry and conversion, data processing, 
        data analysis and control data management or call centre services for 
        exports. Under EHTP Scheme, a unit can be set up for the purpose of manufacture 
        and development of electronics hardware, or electronics hardware and software 
        in an integrated manner for exports. The policy provisions for STP and 
        EHTP Schemes are substantially the same as those applicable to the general 
        EOU Scheme. Thus, the provisions of EXIM Policy regarding importability 
        of goods, DTA sale, clearance of samples, sub-contracting, inter-unit 
        transfer, repairs, re-conditioning and re-engineering, sale of unutilized 
        material, debonding etc. are more or less same for STP/EHTP units as well 
        as general EOUs. However, considering the special requirements of the 
        software/hardware development sector, some specific provisions have been 
        made for the STP/EHTP units in the EXIM Policy as well as in the Customs 
        notifications governing the Scheme, which may be referred to.</font></p>
